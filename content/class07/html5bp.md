### HTML5 Boilerplate

**HTML5 Boilerplate** is 'the web's most popular front-end template'.  Using HTML5BP to start web projects can give you a quick starting point and a base on which to build valid websites.

[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)

You can download HTML5BP directly from this website, but I like to create a custom build using the [Initializr tool](http://www.initializr.com/) (linked from the main HTML5BP site).

Visit the [Initializr tool](http://www.initializr.com/), then choose the following settings (you can choose different ones for other projects or to experiment, but for right now use the settings I have selected).

You will want to unzip this into a **new folder** in your **document root**.  You can call this folder **boilerplate**.
