### Readings

Check out the [9 basic principles of responsive web design](http://blog.froont.com/9-basic-principles-of-responsive-web-design/) - this is short and has lots of graphics.  Do you recognize some of these responsive design patterns?  You should be familiar with the difference between **Relative and Static units**, have a familiarity with **what breakpoints are**, and have a concept of what adding a wrapper with a **max width** will do to your content.

Read the following from Lesson 15 & 22 in [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org/).  These readings will help you to recognize mobile design patterns, and help you review what we learned in today's class.

- [Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) (I know, you've read it before!  Just wanted to remind you it exists.  Do you understand anything about this article more now than you did before?  How has your understanding of this topic changed?)
- [Responsive Navigation Patterns](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/)
- [Multi-Device Layout Patterns](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514)
- [Mobile Patterns](http://www.mobile-patterns.com/)
