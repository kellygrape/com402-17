### Homework

If we haven't finished the Baymax tutorial, finish it on your own time. [CSS Animation Rocks - Baymax](https://cssanimation.rocks/baymax/)

Now that we have learned how to do CSS animations, you should learn WHY and WHEN we should utilize these techniques.  Go back to the start of this lesson, and watch the video I've linked.  It's only 18m long.

Also, read [Why Animate?](https://cssanimation.rocks/why-animate/)

If you're very interested in learning more about this, I suggest you sign up for the [CSS Animation Rocks FREE Course](https://cssanimation.rocks/courses/animation-101/).  You can also check out the Kirupa [Video Series](https://www.kirupa.com/css_animations/index.htm) or the video series from [DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kK-cA99SA0&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4LvJ8VctoXnPI0dtE40wfid)

### When is this due?

No specific due date or requirement to turn any of this in.  That doesn't mean that you shouldn't DO it.  The web development environment is constantly changing and there is *always* something new to learn.  Here's a great opportunity to learn something!

### Project #1 is due Monday, Feb 13.  Don't forget!
