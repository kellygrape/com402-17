### Homework Review

Consider some experiences in your own life that could be described as UX Fails or UX Wins.  Come prepared to discuss in class.


### Slide Deck

## User Experience Foundations

User Experience (UX) is making each user feel like your website was built for them.

You need to consider **who** is your audience and **how** they behave.

### User Personas

  - who are your users?
  - what are their goals?
  - what concerns might stop them from using your site?
  
  (More info at [usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html) and [smashing magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/))
  
### Why do people use the web?

To get information.  People come to your site with a goal in mind.  Think about some sites you visit and what your goal might be for those sites.

When a user visits a site, they have likely landed there via a web search or a link rather than by direct traffic.

Since not all users come to your homepage first, every page should help people orient themselves on your site and work out whether your site has the information they want.

One reason that people may leave your site is because they can't find what they are looking for.  There are many things that can cause this, including

- Using too much jargon
- Difficult to use navigation
- Content that is a “wall of text”
- Annoying advertisements that block content (like [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com))

### Simple, Consistent, and Standard Design

**Simple Design** means...

- Images that match your content (smiling people in stock photos are nice, but do they really help to tell you story?)
- Cutting down on the amount of text
- Making text easily readable and scannable
- Matching advertisements to your user base

Does every element on your page help or hinder your users?


**Consistent Design** means ...

- Have the same response whenever people perform an action
- Using consistent wording
- Using consistent design patterns (for buttons, headings, etc)

> “The more users’ expectations prove right, the more they will feel in control of the system and the more they will like it.” – Jakob Nielson

**Standard Design** means ...

- Using web elements in the same way as other major sites do
- Avoiding overly “trendy” web designs
- Following web design best practices
- Standards can and do change over time
- You can break standards, but you may lose visitors
- Different audiences may have different standards


### Navigation

- Navigation is an important part of the user experience
- Navigation components include global navigation, local navigation, utility navigation, breadcrumbs, filters, facets, related links, footers, fat footers, and so on.
- Navigation can be structured in a variety of ways, depending on the needs of your users
  - sorted by category
  - sorted by audience
  - sorted by task
  
**Information Architecture** is a part of the UX, but is not exactly the same thing as navigation.

- IA refers to the site's **content and functionality**
- IA describes the underlying organization, structure and nomenclature that define the relationships between a site’s content/functionality
