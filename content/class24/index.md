# UX - Out Of Class Work


### What is UX

UX (User Experience) is related to the

- what
- why
- where
- when
- how

of a user's interaction with a product, as well as 

- who

that user is.  The UX describes the user's interaction with a product (or design, or website).

**Examples**

- [NPR](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/470067791/wait-wait-dont-tell-me-for-march-12-2016) (how can I view the transcript for each section?)
- [Giphy](http://giphy.com/gifs/3NtY188QaxDdC) (when you use Giphy on a mobile device, there is a link that makes it really easy to copy and paste a gif - like, into a text!)

# Bracket Madness


- It's NCAA March Madness time!  We missed the first part of the tournament while you were on break, but today is the start of the Sweet 16!
- Take the current Sweet 16 teams and pick a tournament winner by evaluating the websites of each team and choosing the best website.  Pick using your knowledge of usability and evaluating web design.
- This is a highly subjective assignment - you may choose a school to have a superior website based on any number of factors.  Do you think one school makes it easier to apply?  Or one school has a better map?  Do you think that a school without a responsive website automatically loses?  Do you like news on the front page, or not?  Do you think that it should be easy to find visiting times, or easy to apply, or easy to find financial aid?  Or is it a bit of a gut reaction?  There are no wrong reasons to pick a school, but please do use what you have learned so far about UX / good web design to help you make choices.
- Use the **main website for the school** (for SJU, that would be sju.edu), not the **athletics website**.

- Write a 500-700 word narrative about your choice for champion, and how you compared your final two schools to arrive at a winner (you don't have to write a narrative about all of your choices, just the last choice leading to your final school).  Submit this as a Google Doc or a Word Document.  Due BEFORE CLASS on Wednesday, March 22, 2016
