### Exercise (finish for homework)

In the script.js file of the zip folder you downloaded, create a new object.  Call it `recipe`.  Give it three properties: a `title`, `servings`, and `ingredients`.  Ingredients should be stored as an `array` (check out our donaldTrump example - his `children` are stored as an `array`.)  Save this, we will be working on it in class on Friday.
