# Tuesday?

Today we will be looking at the final project, and having an opportunity to begin working on it.

I will also be introducing the concept of *build scripts*, pieces of code that you run on your own computer to help do things like **compile SASS** and **auto-prefix**.

We will be installing FastShell, an HTML starter kit that integrates SASS, jQuery, and builds it all together using Gulp.
