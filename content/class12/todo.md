### The To-Do App

Over the weekend you worked on a small to-do application.

Feel free to save you work somewhere, but I'd like to make sure that we are going to continue working on the same codebase.

Please visit [my completed version of the app](/todo-start) and view the source code.  Use the source code to create a new (or overwrite your current version of) index.html file.

Let's walk though this together.
