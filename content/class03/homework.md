### Due Monday, January 30

#### Coding Assignment #1 - Codepen

*Assigned : 1/23/2016*
*Due: 1/30/2016*

In this assignment, you will demonstrate your knowledge of basic HTML and CSS.

### The Setup

Create a folder called `01-codepen` in your `assignments` folder.  All files for this assignment will go in this folder.

Create an HTML file in that folder and name it `index.html`.  Use the following gist as your HTML base.  This is a good starter for any HTML file.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge, chrome=1" />
<!-- don't forget to add your title -->
<title>untitled</title>
<!-- don't forget to link your stylesheet -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="" />
</head>
<body>
<!-- the content of your page starts here. -->

<!--  if you aren't using javascript, you can delete this -->
<script src=""></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Create three additional HTML files and name them whatever you would like to name them.  Don't forget our best practices for naming HTML files.

Create a `css` folder, and inside of it a file named `style.css`.

### The Content

Look through the [top rated pens of 2016 on Codepen](http://codepen.io/2016/popular/pens/).  Select three pens that you find interesting.

Create a small website to share these three pens with the class.  There should be a main page with links to each of the sub pages.  Each sub page should include a *title*, an *embedded version of the pen*, a *link to the pen*, and 150-300 word *explanation of why you chose the pen*.

### The HTML

- You should have 4 html files in your folder - an index and one file for each of your chosen pens.
- You should have a menu (`nav`) inside which is a list (`ul`) with four items.  Each item should be a link to one of your four pages.  Your navigation should appear on every page.
- Each page should be able to be [validated](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Each page should have similar styling.  Do not use the browser defaults.

### The CSS

- Use an external stylesheet with a <link> tag and a css file. Do not use inline or in-document styling for this assignment.  (What's an external style sheet?  Check out "[Building your First Web Page](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/)" for a refresher)
- Define the basic CSS styles for the `<body>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.
- Create a `wrapper` or `content` div that contains everything in the `<body>`.
- Create at least 2 classes and assign them styles.

### Bonus Challenge

- Was this too easy? Look at your navigation list.  How can you improve it?  Can you get rid of the bullets?  Can you make the items appear in a line (horizontal navigation)?  Or, can you put your navigation into a sidebar?

## Submitting Your Assignment

- On the day they are due, you will present your website to the class.
- You will also create a *zip file* of your entire 01-codepen folder and email it to me.
- I am primarily looking to see that you 1) structured the CSS document correctly and got it working, and 2) did outside research on style properties to execute your design. It's ok if what you have to show the class isn't 100% of what you were aiming for. The point of showing your work is to share what you have and what you might have struggled with, so we can help each other with what we've learned.
