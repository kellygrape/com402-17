Once you've completed Day 1 of Javascript 30, you can skip day 2 (woah, we're rebels!) and go right to Day 3.  We're skipping day 2 because we already made a clock together, but if you want to review or want to see how HE did it, feel free to follow.

### Complete

Complete the third lesson (day three, the playing with variables in CSS)
