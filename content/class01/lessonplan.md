#### Setting Up Your Dev Environment

Before we begin, you should **set up your development environment**. In this class we will use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as a web editor.  Please download it now and install it.

You will also need to set up a directory structure for this class.  On your **Desktop**, create a new folder called **COM402**.  Inside this folder, create **three** subfolders - `assignments`, `classwork`, and `projects`.
