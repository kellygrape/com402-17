### Github

You should have uploaded your project to GitHub.

I recommend using the Github Desktop app for managing your projects in Github.

I will be working individually at the beginning of class with anyone that needs a little refresher on GitHub.

You can [read this guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/) if you just need a little bit of guidance or a refresher.
