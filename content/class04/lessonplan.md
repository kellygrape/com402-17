### Before We Get Started

As we go through some of the slides today, we will be taking periodic breaks to code.  I've set up a sample code file for you.

Please create a folder in your COM402/classwork folder. I named mine "04class" but you can name yours whatever you wish.

Create an index.html in that folder, and use the following gist to get you started.

[Oscar Nominations Sample HTML](https://gist.github.com/kellygrape/96796d5ede3428504253ba0c2ee01c16)

We will be revisiting this file through a few classes, to practice concepts related to layout and CSS.
