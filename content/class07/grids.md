### Grids and CSS

To design with a grid, you need to consider that your content can be broken up into rows and columns.  Every row can have any number of columns, but it looks nice if your columns are of predictable width.

### Grid Systems

There are probably over a hundred grid systems out there. Here are some that I have used and liked.

- [960 Grid System](http://960.gs/) (Note - this is NOT responsive)
- [Skeleton Grid](http://www.getskeleton.com/) (This is one of the simplest frameworks - and one of the first responsive grid systems I encountered!)
- [Base CSS](http://basscss.com/) (another framework, a bit more complicated to get set up but really simple code-wise)
- [Unsemantic Grid](http://unsemantic.com/) (The successor to 960 grid).
- [Gridism](http://cobyism.com/gridism/) (Very different, but simple!)
